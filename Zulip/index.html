				<h1>Open Sourcing Zulip – a Dropbox Hack Week Project</h1>
				<p>Are you bored of IRC and it's non-graphical user interface?</p>
				<p>If yes then there is good news for you. Dropbox has recently launched it's open source chat application <a href="https://zulip.org/" title="Zulip"><strong>Zulip</strong></a> for software developers. </p>
				<p>This year’s Dropbox Hack Week saw some incredible projects take shape – from the talented team that visited Baltimore to research food deserts, to a project to recreate the fictional Pied Piper algorithm from HBO’s Silicon Valley.</p>
				<p>During this year’s Hack Week, Dropbox reassembled the original team from Zulip (a group chat application optimized for software development teams that was acquired by Dropbox in 2014) to tackle open sourcing Zulip on an ambitious timeline.</p>
				<p>"We took on this project during Hack Week in order to enable Zulip’s users to enjoy and improve a product they love.", said Tim Abbott(software developer for Dropbox)</p>

					<p>The world of open source chat has for a long been dominated by IRC and XMPP, both of which are very old and haven’t advanced materially in the last decade. In comparison, Zulip starts with many useful features and integrations expected by software development teams today and has a well-engineered, maintainable codebase for those that are missing.</p>
